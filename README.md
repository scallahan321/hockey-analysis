The basic metrics for evaluating goalie performance in the NHL are shots against, saves, save percentage, and wins. 

I dug deeper into each goalies performance by calculating their save percentage against each shooting position. 

Additionally, I broke this down by the shooters handedness - left or right. As far as I know there isn't a publicly available statistic measuring this.

I used a data set that contains granular play by play data, found here - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martinellis/nhl-game-data

My findings are visualized here - [https://goalies.herokuapp.com/](https://goalies.herokuapp.com/)
